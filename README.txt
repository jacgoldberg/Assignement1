Assignment 1

This assignment is entirely my own work, I did work with chase from the tutoring
center to help try and fix a bug I am currently experiencing. Other than that I
used no outside resources other than https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/186-basic-file-io/
for review with file i/o

***Important: There is a bug in my code revolving the proper assignment of my C
value. My code will quite often assign C to nan which will cause the length of my
string to equal 0. I spoke with professor German about this and he said to not
worry about it if it was my only issue. I also went to the tutoring center and
Chase and I couldn't fix it as well. Proof of the C nan is commented out on lines
310 and 312. Other than that, for the lines it is creating it is creating them
correctly.
